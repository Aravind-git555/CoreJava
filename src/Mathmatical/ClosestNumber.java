/*Given non-zero two integers N and M. The problem is to find the number closest to N and divisible by M. If there are more than one such number, then output the one having maximum absolute value.


Example 1:

Input:
N = 13 , M = 4
Output:
12
Explanation:
12 is the Closest Number to
13 which is divisible by 4.*/
